# MCP Server Configuration for Node.js Sandbox
# Copy this file to .mcp.env and configure as needed

# Node.js Sandbox MCP server typically doesn't require external API keys
# as it runs code in isolated containers locally

# Add any additional environment variables your MCP servers might need
# For example, if you add other MCP servers later:
# GITHUB_TOKEN=your-github-token-here
# OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-key-here
